## SQL2000 and Service Centre


</div>

### Description

This is a complete application with adding, deleting, Editing, Printing in a very good format. It is an idle example for those persons who want to work with the SQL Server 2000 in backend and Visual Basic in front end. I did hard work on this application and I made it easiest process to connect the SQL Server and playing with data in a smooth and easy to understand way. I did not found a complete application, which can demonstrate every thing.
